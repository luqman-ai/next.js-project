    description:`WASHINGTON:<br/>
   <p> An inmate was charged on Friday with attempted murder and other offenses following the stabbing of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer convicted in the death of George Floyd, the US Justice Department said in a statement.
    
    The complaint charges John Turscak, 52, with stabbing Chauvin about 22 times "with an improvised knife" on Nov. 24 while incarcerated at Federal Correctional Institution Tucson, prosecutors said.
    
    Turscak was charged with attempted murder, assault with intent to commit murder, assault with a dangerous weapon, and assault resulting in serious bodily injury, according to prosecutors.
    
    Turscak is serving a 30-year sentence over crimes that were committed when he was a member of the Mexican Mafia gang.
    
    The investigation in the case was conducted by the FBI.</P>
    
    "Turscak stated that his attack of D.C. (Derek Chauvin) on Black Friday was symbolic with the Black Lives Matter movement and the Mexican Mafia criminal organization," the complaint said.

    Turscak also told investigators he had been thinking of assaulting the former police officer for about a month due to his high-profile status, according to prosecutors.
    
    An attorney for Turscak was not listed in court records.
    
    Attempted murder and assault with intent to commit murder violations each carry maximum penalties of 20 years’ incarceration, while assault with a dangerous weapon and assault resulting in serious bodily injury each carry maximum penalties of 10 years.
    
    Chauvin was expected to survive, the Minnesota Attorney General's office said after the stabbing.
    
    Chauvin is serving a 21-year sentence for violating Floyd's civil rights and a concurrent 22-1/2 years for murder on his conviction in Minnesota state court.
    
    Floyd's death in 2020 unleashed protests worldwide against police brutality and racism after Chauvin, who is white, knelt on the neck of the handcuffed Black man for more than eight minutes in a murder caught on cellphone video.`},

    description:`GAZA:
    Israel carried out deadly bombardments in Gaza for a second day on Saturday after a week-long truce with Hamas collapsed despite international calls for an extension.
    
    Clouds of grey smoke from the strikes hung over Gaza, where the health ministry said nearly 200 people had been killed since the pause in hostilities expired early Friday.
    
    Both sides blamed each other for breaking the truce, with Israel claiming that Hamas had tried to fire a rocket before it ended and that it failed to produce a list of further hostages for release.
    
    "What we're doing now is striking Hamas military targets all over the Gaza Strip," Israel Defense Forces spokesman Jonathan Conricus told reporters on Saturday.
    
    As hostilities resumed, Hamas's armed wing received "the order to resume combat" and to "defend the Gaza Strip", according to a source close to the group who asked not to be named because they were not authorised to speak to the media.
    
    International leaders and humanitarian groups condemned the return to fighting.
    
    "I deeply regret that military operations have started again in Gaza," UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres said on X, formerly Twitter.
    
    "Today, in a matter of hours, scores were reportedly killed and injured," UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said.
    
    "Families were told to evacuate, again. Hopes were dashed."
    
    Fears of a wider regional conflict grew after the Syrian defence ministry said Israeli strikes had hit Damascus on Saturday and Hezbollah said one of its members had been killed in an Israeli strike on Lebanon on Friday.
    
    The United States said it is working with regional partners to reach another ceasefire.
    
    "We're going to continue to work with Israel and Egypt and Qatar on efforts to reimplement the pause," US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters in California on Friday.
    
    Mediation efforts by Qatar and Egypt are ongoing, said a source briefed on the talks who asked not to be named.
    
    Israel vowed to eliminate Hamas in response to the October 7 raid and unleashed an air and ground campaign that has killed more than 15,000 Palestinians, of which around 40pc were children.
    
    But in a diplomatic breakthrough, both sides agreed to a seven-day truce, during which Hamas freed 80 Israeli captives in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners, and more aid entered Gaza.
    
    The week of captive-prisoner exchanges yielded tearful reunions of Israeli families with their released relatives and jubilation in the streets of the occupied West Bank as Palestinian prisoners walked free from Israeli jails.
    
    Twenty-five other captives, mostly Thais, were also freed in separate arrangements.

    The Israeli army said Friday that five more captives had died, bringing the total number to seven, and 136 were still being held, including 17 women and children.
    
    US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters in Dubai on Friday that the United States remained "intensely focused on getting everyone home, getting hostages back" and "pursuing the process that had worked for seven days" during the truce.
    
    But Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy told reporters: "Having chosen to hold onto our women, Hamas will now take the mother of all thumpings."
    
    The Israeli military claimed that "ground, air and naval forces struck terror targets in the north and south of the Gaza Strip, including in Khan Yunis and Rafah."
    
    Israeli forces carried out operations early Saturday in various areas of the occupied West Bank, according to the official Palestinian news agency Wafa.
    
    Outside the Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City, a man in a blue sweater bellowed in grief and turned his face and hands to the sky after viewing a dead boy in a body bag, AFPTV footage showed.
    
    "What did he do wrong? God, what did we do to deserve this?" he yelled.
    
    Guterres has warned of a "humanitarian catastrophe" in Gaza, where the United Nations says 1.7 million people are displaced and short of food, water and other essentials.
    
    "The healthcare service is on its knees," Rob Holden, a World Health Organization (WHO) senior emergency officer, told journalists from Gaza as explosions were heard in the background.
    
    "It is like a horror movie."
    
    On a bed at Khan Yunis's Nasser hospital, Amal Abu Dagga wept, her beige veil covered in blood.
    
    "I don't even know what happened to my children," she said. A relative, Jamil Abu Dagga, told AFP the family had been at home when the bombs started falling.
    
    In Israel, sirens warning of potential missiles sounded in several communities near Gaza. Authorities said they were restarting security measures in the area, including closing schools.
    
    A rocket strike destroyed a van in one Israeli community near Gaza.
    
    "Today, the Gaza Strip is once again the most dangerous place in the world to be a child," UNICEF's executive director Catherine Russell said in a statement Saturday.

    The Israeli military published a map of "evacuation zones" in the Gaza Strip that it claimed would enable residents to "evacuate from specific places for their safety if required". Many Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli military while following earlier 'evacuation' orders.
    
    Residents in various areas of Gaza were sent SMS warnings on Friday.
    
    Israeli forces "will begin a crushing military attack on your area of residence with the aim of eliminating the terrorist organisation Hamas," the warnings said.
    
    "Stay away from all military activity of every kind."

        descerption:`ISLAMABAD:
        Former prime minister and PTI chief Imran Khan had extended the offer of chairmanship of the party to Hamid Khan before picking Barrister Gohar Ali Khan. However, sources privy to the behind-the-scenes developments disclosed that Hamid Khan declined the offer citing concerns about his age and health
        
        Instead, he suggested Shah Mahmood Qureshi as a potential replacement for the jailed politician. Nonetheless, Qureshi's candidacy was dismissed due to his imprisonment. The revelations come as the PTI has been trudging along a legal minework to preempt further legal woes if its intra-party polls fall short of the requirements set by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
        
        The party's recent announcement that Imran Khan would refrain from participating in the intra-party polls due to legal constraints led to Gohar's nomination as an interim arrangement. However, the unprecedented move –- fuelling speculations about the 'minus-Imran formula' – came amid apparent tensions within the party.
        
        Read Imran 'picks' Barrister Gohar for PTI chairman slot
        
        PTI's spokesperson Shoaib Shaheen, speaking to The Express Tribune, confirmed Imran Khan's offer of chairmanship to Hamid Khan who turned down the offer. He also dispelled any notions of discord among party leaders regarding Barrister Gohar's nomination, emphasising unity within the party.
        
        "My point was that the announcement of the nomination should have not been made before the Islamabad High Court hearing about Imran Khan's plea regarding the suspension of the trial court judgement in the Toshakhana case.
        
        The hearing was scheduled for Thursday. Now the IHC division bench has reserved its decision. The announcement of Barrister Gohar Khan was made on Wednesday by Senator Ali Zafar.” Giving the rationale for not nominating any other senior political leader as party chairman, Shoaib Shaheen said that they do not want to give the impression that the party has accepted a “minus-one formula”.
        
        Meanwhile, Hamid Khan himself confirmed that he had excused himself from accepting the chairmanship of the party. He also supported Barrister Gohar Khan's nomination as the new PTI chairman in the prevailing political situation wherein political leaders are either underground or imprisoned.
        
        Read Imran names temporary successor
        
        Hamid Khan hoped that the president and Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa would ensure the rule of law and supremacy of the constitution in the country. It's worth noting that Hamid previously represented various bar associations that challenged the presidential reference against Justice Qazi Faez Isa during the PTI regime. He openly opposed the PTI government's decision to file a reference against Justice Isa allegedly at the behest of the establishment.
        
        Moreover, during the PTI government, Hamid Khan wasn't closely associated with Imran. However, following Imran Khan's ousting through a constitutional process, Hamid Khan's proximity to the former seemingly increased.
        
        Within the PTI circles, there's a belief that PPP senior lawyer Chaudhry Aitzaz Ahsan shares a close relationship with Imran Khan. It's notable that Barrister Gohar, Aitzaz's junior, continues to work alongside him, prompting discussions among certain sections within PTI.
        
        Read more PTI gears up for intra-party polls sans Imran
        
        Chaudhry Aitzaz Ahsan will call the shots behind the scenes. Hamid said that Gohar was appointed to end legal impediments to the allotment of its 'Bat' symbol. However, Shoaib Shaheen said that the PTI core committee would continue the work.
        
        It is being witnessed that presently lawyers are the driving seat of the PTI, with many seeking PTI tickets in the upcoming elections. Among them, Shoaib Shaheen, Dr Babar Awan, and Ali Bukhari have expressed interest in contesting PTI tickets in Islamabad.

        slug:"Import measures yield $4.8b savings",
        descreption:`ISLAMABAD:
        Last month, Pakistan maintained tight control over imports to offset the shortfall in foreign loans, resulting in a trade deficit of only $9.4 billion during the first five months of this fiscal year – saving about $4.8 billion through administrative measures.
        
        The latest trade bulletin from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) for November also suggests that the country’s annual imports may now remain even lower than the downward revised estimates by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
        
        The gap between imports and exports shrank to $9.4 billion during the July-November period of the current fiscal year, according to the national data collecting agency. The trade deficit was $4.8 billion or 34% less than the comparative period of the last fiscal year, it added.
        
        The continued tight control over imports has lessened the pressure on foreign exchange reserves, which slipped to $7.2 billion as of last month despite the IMF programme. The low available financing leaves the government with no option but to keep managing international trade.
        
        Unlike the previous programme, the IMF has not pressed Pakistan hard to arrange additional foreign loans despite a gap. It has also not created troubles for Islamabad on the issue of restrictions on imports.
        
        During the recent review talks, the IMF has cut its projections of the current account deficit and imports. But the latest statistics indicate that imports may now remain even lower than the already downward revised projections by the global lender.
        
        During the first five months, Pakistan imported $21.6 billion worth of goods, down by $4.5 billion, or just over 17%, compared with the same period last year. The imports during the first five months were equal to only 37% of the new IMF projection of $58.4 billion.
        
        The IMF had not accepted the finance ministry’s projection of imports worth $54.5 billion during this fiscal year. The lender has now estimated it at $58.4 billion, but its revised figure is $6.3 billion less than what it estimated in July this year.
        
        Effectively, every saved dollar through the reduction in imports is taking the pressure off the reserves that still remain at a critical level of only 1.4 months of import cover.
        
        The curb on imports does have implications for the country’s economic growth and inflation. The IMF has also lowered the economic growth forecast to 2% for this fiscal year after it remained negative 0.2% in the previous year.
        
        Read: $8b discrepancy unearthed in exports, imports
        
        The PBS stated that exports marginally increased during the July-November period and stood at $12.2 billion. There was a $230 million increase in exports in five months. The five months’ exports were equal to 40% of the IMF’s downward revised projection of $30.6 billion.
        
        On a month-on-month basis, the trade deficit also shrank 13.2% despite some contraction in exports. Exports decreased 4.4% to under $2.6 billion last month. Imports too reduced 8.3% to $4.5 billion. The month-on-month trade deficit further shrank to $1.9 billion.
        
        The rupee swings continue post the IMF talks. After peaking at Rs288 to a dollar, it has again marginally appreciated on a daily basis, and its value has now dropped below Rs285.
        
        Pakistan’s gross external financing needs had been estimated at over $28 billion at the start of this fiscal year. The figure is now revised to $25 billion by the IMF due to fewer imports, restructuring of 31 Chinese loans issued by the Export-Import Bank of China, and major dollar purchases by the central bank from the market.
        
        On a year-on-year basis, in November, exports amounted to $2.6 billion, higher by $183 million, or 7.7%, compared to the same month of last year. But the imports dropped 13.5% to $4.5 billion. As a result, the trade deficit narrowed 32% to $1.9 billion in November, a reduction of $877 million compared to the same month of last year.
        
        The Washington-based lender had not agreed to Pakistan’s projection of $4 billion to $4.5 billion current account deficit during this fiscal year against the earlier projected figure of $6.5 billion. The IMF now projects a deficit of $5.7 billion -- a reduction of about $770 million compared to its old estimates.

        The statement released by the apex court added that CJP Isa "shall continue to fulfil his duties and abide by the oath of his office”.
        
        On November 30, former prime minister Imran in his letter to the CJP urged the release of female prisoners arrested during the May 9 riots.

        descreption:`CAIRO/ DUBAI/ LONDON:
        Israel has informed several Arab states that it wants to carve out a buffer zone on the Palestinian side of Gaza's border to prevent future attacks as part of proposals for the enclave after war ends, Egyptian and regional sources said.
        
        According to three regional sources, Israel related its plans to its neighbours Egypt and Jordan, along with the United Arab Emirates, which normalised ties with Israel in 2020.
        
        They also said that Saudi Arabia, which does not have ties with Israel and which halted a US-mediated normalisation process after the Gaza war flared on Oct. 7, had been informed. The sources did not say how the information reached Riyadh, which officially does not have direct communication channels with Israel. Non-Arab Turkey was also told, the sources said.
        
        The initiative does not indicate an imminent end to Israel's offensive - which resumed on Friday after a seven-day truce - but it shows Israel is reaching out beyond established Arab mediators, such as Egypt or Qatar, as it seeks to shape a post-war Gaza.
        
        No Arab states have shown any willingness to police or administer Gaza in future and most have roundly condemned Israel's offensive that has killed more than 15,000 people and levelled swathes of Gaza's urban areas. Hamas killed 1,200 people in its Oct. 7 raid and took more than 200 hostages.
        
        "Israel wants this buffer zone between Gaza and Israel from the north to the south to prevent any Hamas or other militants from infiltrating or attacking Israel," said a senior regional security official, one of the three regional sources who asked not to be identified by nationality.
        
        Read also: Relentless Israeli strikes rock Gaza for second day after truce collapse
        
        The Egyptian, Saudi, Qatari and Turkish governments did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Jordanian officials could not immediately be reached for comment.
        
        A UAE official did not respond directly when asked if Abu Dhabi had been told about the buffer zone, but said: "The UAE will support any future post-war arrangements agreed upon by all the concerned parties" to achieve stability and a Palestinian state.
        
        Asked about plans for a buffer zone, Ophir Falk, foreign policy adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told Reuters: "The plan is more detailed than that. It's based on a three-tier process for the day after Hamas."
        
        Outlining the Israeli government's position, he said the three tiers involved destroying Hamas, demilitarising Gaza and de-radicalising the enclave.
        
        "A buffer zone may be part of the demilitarisation process," he said. He declined to offer details when asked whether those plans had been raised with international partners, including Arab states.
        
        Arab states have dismissed as impossible Israel's goal of wiping out Hamas, saying it was more than simply a ‘militant’ force that could be defeated.
        
        Squeezing Palestinian
        
        Israel has suggested in the past it was considering a buffer zone inside Gaza, but the sources said it was now presenting them to Arab states as part of its future security plans for Gaza. Israeli troops withdrew from the enclave in 2005.
        
        A US official, who declined to be identified, said Israel had "floated" the buffer zone idea without saying to whom. But the official also repeated Washington's opposition to any plan that reduced the size of Palestinian territory.
        
        Jordan, Egypt and other Arab states have voiced fears that Israel wants to squeeze Palestinians out of Gaza, repeating the dispossession of land Palestinians suffered when Israel was created in 1948. The Israeli government denies any such aim.
        
        A senior Israeli security source said the buffer zone idea was "being examined", adding: "It is not clear at the moment how deep this will be and whether it could be 1 km or 2 km or hundreds of metres (inside Gaza)."

        Any encroachment into Gaza, which is about 40 km (25 miles) long and between about 5 km (3 miles) and 12 km (7.5 miles) wide, would cram its 2.3 million people into an even smaller area.
        
        In Washington, an Israeli official said the Israeli defence establishment was talking about "some kind of security buffer on the Gaza side of the border so that Hamas cannot gather military capabilities close to the border and surprise Israel again."
        
        "It is a security measure, not a political one," the official said on condition of anonymity. "We do not intend to remain on the Gaza side of the border."
        
        Till now, Egypt, the first Arab state to sign a peace deal with Israel, and Qatar, which does not have formal ties but keeps communication channels open, have been at the centre of mediation talks with Israel that have focused on exchanging hostages held by Hamas for Palestinians in Israeli jails.
        
        Shifting focus
        
        Two Egyptian security sources said Israel had raised the idea in mediation talks with Egypt and Qatar of disarming northern Gaza and setting up a buffer zone in north Gaza with international supervision.
        
        The sources said several Arab states opposed this. While Arab states might not oppose a security barrier between the two sides, there was disagreement over where it was located, they added.
        
        The Egyptian sources said Israel had said in a meeting in Cairo in November that the Hamas leaders should be tried internationally in return for a full ceasefire. Mediators said the issue should be postponed until after the war to avoid derailing talks about hostage releases, the sources said.
        
        A source in the Israeli prime minister's office declined to address the reports, adding: "Netanyahu's War Cabinet has defined the war missions: destroy Hamas and bring all the hostages back home, and we will continue until we complete our missions."
        
        One of the Egyptian sources said Israel, in its discussions with Egypt and Qatar, had shifted from a focus on retaliation earlier in the crisis towards showing a greater willingness to "rethink its demands as mediation continued."
        
        The regional sources compared the Gaza buffer zone plan to the "security zone" Israel once had in south Lebanon. Israel evacuated that zone, which was about 15 km (10 miles) deep, in 2000 after years of fighting and attacks by Lebanon's Hezbollah.
        
        Read: Scores reported killed in Gaza after Israel-Hamas truce collapses
        
        They also said Israel's plan for post-war Gaza included deporting leaders of Hamas, an action that would also mirror the Israeli campaign in Lebanon in the 1980s when it drove out the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which had launched attacks from Lebanon into Israel.
        
        "Israel is ready to pay a costly price to expel and evict Hamas completely from Gaza to other countries in the region similar to what it did in Lebanon, but it's not the same. Getting rid of Hamas is difficult and not certain," said another of the regional officials familiar with the discussions.
        
        A senior Israeli official said Israel did not consider Hamas to be like the PLO nor believe that it would act like the PLO.
        
        Mohammad Dahlan, Gaza's former security chief from the Palestinian Fatah faction which was ejected from the enclave when Hamas took control in 2007, said Israel's buffer zone plan was unrealistic and would not protect Israeli forces.
        
        "The buffer zone could make (Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu's forces a target also in the zone," he said.`

        More than 30 people sustained injuries, and 13 official vehicles were set ablaze during the operation, he argued. The officer further contended that the report of the polygraphy test on Sanam’s speeches and interviews is yet to be received.
        
        Additionally, the law officer pointed out to the court that three petrol bombs were recovered from her possession. He emphasized that in cases where the accused was found in possession of petrol bombs, no one has been granted bail.

        The petitioner's counsel expressed frustration, urging the court that the allegations against her "have nothing to do with reality". He argued that his client was falsely implicated, solely to humiliate and embarrass her.
        
        In response to the ATC judge's inquiry about when the petrol bombs were recovered from the accused's possession, the law officer stated that the bombs were found on November 16 from Zaman Park. He said the petrol bombs were discovered after digging a piece of land at Zaman Park.
        
        "It is astonishing that the incident was reported on March 14, while the bombs were recovered on November 16," the counsel for the accused petitioner pointed out. He highlighted that the law officer was discussing the recovery of petrol bombs from a venue that the administration had already cleaned up, and the bomb disposal had cleared the area.
        
        The accused petitioner's counsel argued that the "actual reason behind humiliating Sanam Javed was her criticism of [PML-N vice president] Maryam Nawaz on social media".
        
        It is pertinent to mention that the Racecourse police had registered an FIR against several accused, including Sanam Javed, for attacking police officials, setting police vans ablaze, injuring officials, creating law and order issues, causing anarchy and chaos, and engaging in arson during a police operation at Zaman Park.`

        descreption:`GAZA:
        Israel's warplanes pounded Gaza on Friday after talks to extend a week-old truce with Hamas broke down, sending wounded and dead Palestinians into hospitals and others onto the streets to seek safety.
        
        Eastern areas of Khan Younis in southern Gaza came under intensive bombardment as the deadline lapsed shortly after dawn, with columns of smoke rising into the sky, Reuters journalists in the city said. Residents took to the road with belongings heaped up in carts, fleeing for shelter further west.
        
        In the north of the enclave, previously the main war zone, huge plumes of smoke rose above the ruins, seen from across the fence in Israel. The rattle of gunfire and thud of explosions rang out above the sound of barking dogs.

        Rocket sirens also blared across southern Israel as fighters fired from the coastal enclave into towns.
        
        Within hours of the truce expiring, Gaza health officials reported that 109 people had been killed and dozens wounded in air strikes that hit at least eight homes.
        
        Medics and witnesses said the bombing was most intense in Khan Younis and Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, where hundreds of thousands of Gazans have been sheltering from fighting further north. Houses in central and northern areas were also hit.

        "Anas, my son!" wailed the mother of Anas Anwar al-Masri, a boy lying on a stretcher with a head injury in the corridor of Nasser hospital in Khan Younis. "I don't have anyone but you!"
        
        Further south in Rafah, residents carried several small children, streaked with blood and covered in dust, out of a house that had been struck. Mohammed Abu-Elneen, whose father owns the house, said it was sheltering people displaced from elsewhere.

        At the nearby Abu Yousef al-Najjar hospital, the first wave of wounded were men and boys.
        
        Gazans said they feared that the bombing of southern parts of the enclave could herald an expansion of the war into areas Israel had previously described as safe.
        
        Leaflets dropped on eastern areas of the main southern city Khan Younis ordered residents of four towns to evacuate - not to other areas in Khan Younis as in the past, but further south to the crowded town of Rafah on the Egyptian border.
        
        "You have to evacuate immediately and go to the shelters in the Rafah area. Khan Younis is a dangerous fighting zone. You have been warned," said the leaflets, written in Arabic.
        
        Israel released a link to a map showing Gaza divided into hundreds of districts, which it said would be used in future to communicate which areas were safe.
        
        
        The United Nations said the collapse of the ceasefire would worsen an extreme humanitarian emergency.
        
        "Hell on Earth has returned to Gaza," said Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the UN humanitarian office in Geneva.
        
        There were expressions of regret and dismay from leaders around the world, though notable silence, at least initially, from Washington, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on a trip to the region, declining to answer questions about it to reporters on his plane.
        
        Each of the warring sides blamed the other for causing the collapse by rejecting terms to extend the daily release of hostages held by fighters in exchange for Palestinian detainees.

        The pause which began on Nov. 24 had been extended twice, and Israel had said it could continue as long as Hamas released 10 hostages each day. But after seven days during which women, children and foreign hostages were freed, mediators failed at the final hour to find a formula to release more, including Israeli soldiers and civilian men.
        
        Israel accused Hamas of refusing to release all the women it held. A Palestinian official said the breakdown occurred over female Israeli soldiers.
        
        
        Qatar, which has played a central role in mediation efforts, said negotiations were still ongoing with Israelis and Palestinians to restore the truce, but that Israel's renewed bombardment of Gaza had complicated its efforts.
        
        Israel has sworn to annihilate Hamas in response to the Oct. 7 rampage, when Israel says gunmen killed 1,200 people and took 240 hostages. Hamas, sworn to Israel's destruction, has ruled Gaza since 2007.
        
        Israel's bombardment and ground invasion have laid waste to much of the territory. Palestinian health authorities deemed reliable by the United Nations say more than 15,000 Gazans have been confirmed killed and thousands more are missing and feared buried under rubble.
        
        The United Nations says as many as 80% of Gaza's 2.3 million have been driven from their homes, with no way to escape the narrow territory, many sleeping rough in makeshift shelters.
        
        Israel has imposed a total siege, and residents and humanitarian agencies say aid that arrived during the truce was trivial compared to the vast needs of so many displaced people.
        
        Drivers at the crossing from Egypt said the resumption of fighting had halted the movement into Gaza of aid trucks, which go through a laborious process of Israeli inspections that had sped up during the truce.
        
        "The bombardment has been going on since seven in the morning. There are planes and artillery and we haven't moved," said driver Saleh Ebada, who had already been waiting to enter the crossing for inspection for eight days.
        
        Washington has said publicly that it was putting pressure on its ally Israel to better protect civilians once war resumed. Blinken, who had met Israeli and Palestinian officials on Thursday on his third trip to the region since the war began, had praised the truce and said Washington hoped it would be extended.`
